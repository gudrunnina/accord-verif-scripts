# accord-verif-scripts
This a standard set of scripts to carry out
a point-verification using the [harp library](https://github.com/harphub/harp).
The scripts were developed during the [ACCORD MQA working week in Helsinki](https://opensource.umr-cnrm.fr/projects/accord/wiki/MQAWW202206), with contributions from James Fannon, Daniel Yazgi, Florian Weidle, Carl Fortelius, Andrew Singleton and Carlos Peralta.

Currently, the scripts include only deterministic measures, based on what is provided in the [monitor verification package](https://hirlam.github.io/Monitor/dev/) and include: bias, rmse, stdev, equitable threat score, extreme dependency score, false-alarm rate, false-alarm ratio, frequency distribution, frequency bias, Kuiper skill score, as well as timeseries plot of daily variations versus validdate, validhour and scatter plots.

Contributions are welcome. Please see instructions on how to contribute below.
